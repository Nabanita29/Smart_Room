# About Dataset
TACO is a growing image dataset of waste in the wild. It contains images of litter taken under diverse environments: woods, roads and beaches. These images are manually labeled and segmented according to a hierarchical taxonomy to train and evaluate object detection algorithms. Currently, images are hosted on Flickr and we have a server that is collecting more images and annotations @tacodataset.org
